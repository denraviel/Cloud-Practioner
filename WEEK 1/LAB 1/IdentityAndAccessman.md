2. Activate Multifactor authentication for root user

On the right side of the navigation bar, I choose my account name and then chose security credentials 

Then I clicked on Multi-factor authentication 
Chose Activate MFA 
Directed me to a new window to choose the type of MFA device to assign, I chose Virtual MFA device and then clicked continue

Directed me to another window to set up virtual MFA device 


I downloaded google authenticator to use as my virtual MFA app as suggested in the previous class
 
Scanned the barcode from the app and then it automatically added my root aws account to the app where I inputed two consecutive codes generated from the app then clicked assign MFA 

A new wizard pops up saying you have successfully assigned virtual MFA

3. Create a user who is an admin for the root user

To create a user admin account for the root user,I clicked on services on the dashboard then clicked on IAM to go to the IAM console,In the navigation pane,I clicked on User groups  and then clicked on create group
I created a group called "Admin" and attached the AdministrativeAccess policy to the group.This policy provides full access to aws services ans resources and then i clicked on create group

After creating a user group i went back to the IAM console clicked on user and then clicked on add user to create a user, Under user details i typed in the name of the user as Principal_Admin and since i want this user to have root account priviledges i allowed both programmatic access and AWS Management Console access.
I allowed autogenerated password and ticked the box to Require password reset. Then clicked on Next to take me to permission page.
On the permission page I added the user Principal_Admin to the Admin group then clicked on next which takes me to the tags page since tags are optional I clicked next which takes me to review page.After reviewing I clicked on create user.
